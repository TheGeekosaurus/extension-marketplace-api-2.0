# E-commerce Arbitrage Assistant Features

This document outlines the features and capabilities of the E-commerce Arbitrage Assistant Chrome extension, explaining how each component works and how to use it effectively.

## Core Features

### 1. Product Data Extraction

The extension can automatically extract product information from supported e-commerce websites:

- **Amazon**: Extracts ASIN, title, price, brand, and image URL
- **Walmart**: Extracts product ID, UPC, title, price, brand, and image URL
- **Target**: Extracts TCIN, UPC, title, price, brand, and image URL
- **Home Depot**: Extracts product information when available

The extraction process happens automatically when you visit a product page and can be manually triggered with the "Refresh Product Data" button.

After extracting product data, the extension can search for the same product on other marketplaces to identify arbitrage opportunities:

- Shows potential profit amount and percentage

### 3. Mock Data Mode

The extension includes a mock data feature that works without requiring API keys or backend services:

- Simulates product matches based on the source product
- Creates realistic price variations to demonstrate potential profits
- Works offline and requires no additional setup

### 4. Settings Customization

The Settings tab allows you to customize various aspects of the extension:
